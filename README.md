This app was my final project for my course at Austin Coding Academy.

What it essentially does, is it takes data of weapon items from the game 'Destiny 2'
and displays and categorizes them  based on the filters available.
By default it displays every weapon available currently in the game.

Its current state is more of a prototype and I would like to improve on the current state of it in the future.
